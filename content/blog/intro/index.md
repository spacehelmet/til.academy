Hey, Excited to announce a short and summarized blog that everyone can contribute!
TIL.Academy is a place to share interesting facts about tech and not only.

Oh well, yet another blog... No!
We learn every single day and that's awesome. Why don't we go even further and share what we learned with the community?
