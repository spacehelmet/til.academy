Pair programming is a methodology in [Extreme Programming (XP)](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/). If done right it will lead to a high quality codebase, improved collaboration and synchronization between developers.
It is highly productive to have developers sit side-by-side and work on a same codebase. However, sometimes there is a need to pair remotely.
Here are the tools and strategies that can be used during remote pairing.

## üñ•Ô∏è Screen sharing

As pair programming requires both developers to have a full control over the machine, we will be looking for a tool or set of tools that will let both developers control the entire screen, specifically terminal, IDE and browser, and, obviously, have an audio option too.

Let's start from screen sharing.
There are multiple solutions in the market, however the one that stands out is [Zoom](https://zoom.us/meetings).
* It let's you control collaborators screen (mouse/keyboard)
* It has an audio option (of course!)

The only drawback, of course, if we can call it a drawback, is that both developers need to have zoom app installed.

## ‚öí IDE Session Share

If you are using Visual Studio Code then there is a nice bonus tool for you! Microsoft has released a [nice extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack) to their IDE that let's you share your session with anyone.

It has an audio support too! However, you'll need a screen sharing tool in combination with it.
