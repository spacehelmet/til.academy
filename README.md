## Contributing

TIL is designed to be open for all. We are excited to see what you have learned and want to share with the world!
As each and every blog post in TIL lives as a static Markdown in order to add a post you need to open a PR with your markdown inside.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Remember\!**
> * There are a number of maintainers that decide what goes into the blogs
> * Maintainers are benevolent, i.e. in general they want your post to be published. However every PR is subject to evaluation against bad language/value/respect etc.
> * A blog post should comply to the general Markdown conventions
> * No copy-paste, however if your post contains citations make sure to reference the original author
